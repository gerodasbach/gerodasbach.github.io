I am Gero Dasbach, a doctoral student at the [Lille Economie et Management](https://www.lem.univ-lille.fr) laboratory under supervision of [Quentin David](https://sites.google.com/site/quentinmaxdavid/) and [Abel Francois](https://abelfrancois.com/). 

My Ph.D thesis will cover the __political economy__ of the __regional attractivity of international flows__, such as __foreign direct investment (FDI)__. First, I plan to analyze the drivers of firms' outward FDI location choices at different geographical scales - from the country- to the municipality level. 

My further research interests concern the __interplay of environmental and trade policy__, for instance the interplay of border carbon adjustment and free trade agreements.
