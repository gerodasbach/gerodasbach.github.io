======
I am Gero Dasbach, a doctoral student at the [Lille Economie et Management](https://www.lem.univ-lille.fr) laboratory. 

My main research interests cover the __political economy of__ international exchanges, such as __foreign direct investment (FDI)__, migration and trade. 

Moreover, I am interested in the __interplay of environmental and trade policy__, for instance the ex-ante policy evaluation of border carbon adjustment in connection to trade policies.  

Getting started
======
in France's "Flemish capital"

This template was forked from the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
