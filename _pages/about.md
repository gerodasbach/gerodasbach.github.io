I am Gero Dasbach, a doctoral student at the [Lille Economie et Management](https://www.lem.univ-lille.fr) laboratory. 

My Ph.D thesis will cover the __political economy of the regional attractivity of international flows__, such as __foreign direct investment (FDI)__, and trade. My goal is to analyze the drivers of firms' location choices at different jurisdictional levels - from the nation state to the municipality. [Quentin David](https://sites.google.com/site/quentinmaxdavid/) and [Abel Francois](https://abelfrancois.com/) will supervise me in this work. 

My further research interests concern the __interplay of environmental and trade policy__, for instance the ex-ante policy evaluation of border carbon adjustment in connection to trade policies.
