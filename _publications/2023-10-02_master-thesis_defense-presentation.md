title: "The EU-India Free Trade Agreement: Trade, CO2 Emissions, and Welfare Effects under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism"
collection: research
permalink: /research/2023-10-02_master-thesis_defense-presentation
excerpt: 'My master's thesis quantifies the static trade, CO2 emissions, and welfare effects associated with a phase-in of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the EU-India Free Trade Agreement. A general equilibrium model relying on the Armington assumption as a motive for trade is used to evaluate both counterfactual general equilibrium policy changes, ex-ante. Then, the effects of the CBAM are compared to the effects of the EU-India FTA. Multilateral country-sector level data on trade flows and CO2 emissions stem from the OECD Inter-Country Input-Output Tables (ICIO) and the Trade in Embodied CO2 Database (TECO2).'
